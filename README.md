* To be able to implement the ADTs stack, queue, and deque using Python lists.
* To understand the performance of the implementations of basic linear data structures.
* To be able to recognize problem properties where stacks, queues, and deques are appropriate data structures.

## Acknowledgements
This repository is a basic introduction to some of the most important data structures in computer science.

The code examples are in Python, and the explanations assume that you are a software engineer.
